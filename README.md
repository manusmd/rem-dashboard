# Remazing Dashboard

This app is part of a frontend coding challenge

## Technologies

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- JSON Server
- Framer Motion

Besides of the basic technologies like react, typescript and vite I used some additional tools or libraries:

### JSON Server

JSON Server is just a little mockup server since I don't want to have a simple object for the brands data in my code.
I used it to simulate an API which delivers the brand name and logos.
For the mock data I used https://www.generatormix.com/random-companies-and-brands

### Framer Motion

Framer Motion is a library for smooth transitions and animations. I worked a few times with it and I think it makes an app look much more professional. But you shouldn't exaggerate with it.

## Start App

To start the app you shoul start the api first:

```
npm run api-server
```

Then you can start the vite app:

```
npm run dev
```
